The project consisted of creating an MVP of the app. With the implementation of the main functionalities.

 - Users log in only with username (proper authentication was not a requirement)
   - Before a user logs in they can only see the Log in/Sign up page
   - When they log in they have full access to the app
 - Users can create opinions/tweets
 - Users can follow other users
 - Users can add a profile photo and a profile cover image
   - They can upload the images while signing up 
   - Or, later on through the settings page
 - The discover page shows the most recent opinions/tweets from users that are not followed by the logged in user

 - The app is an MVP of the full product - with the full graphical design, but only basic features that can be extended in the future.
